                    <p>To prove that our extensive Moss reaches ‘all’ the way to the ‘river’ Glaze I decided that we could meet at it most western extremities with our parking spot just over on the Cheshire border near the Raven Pub/Restaurant.</p>

                    <p>Thus soon after all were safely gathered together and debrief over we headed off east along Moss Lane and after but a short while we could breathe a big sigh of relief as we crossed the Glaze and onto our Greater Manchester Greenbelt.</p>

                    <p>A renegade Schnauzer Dog from the said Cheshire parking location then decided to follow us ignoring all our efforts to encourage it back home thus we gave up on these attempts and ended up with a mascot for the day---which we found to be quite obedient in every other way save for obeying our commands to go home---eventually we were able to put a temporary lead on it—give it some water and finally get it back safely home to its owners!</p>

                    <p>...anyway back to birdwatching our first summer migrants then came into view as six Sand Martin busied themselves above the laze along which they will spend the summer if they can find a suitably stable bank into which they will tunnel out their nests and hopefully raise two broods of young before they head off to Senegal for the winter.</p>

                    <p>Swifts then drew our attention high into to a sky so blue that it would have been hard to imagine this was the UK in spring if it wasn’t for the easterly wind that caressed us with its steely cold edge! These birds too are migrants here for the summer but they make their nests high in the eaves of houses where they will for just the breeding season actually come to land for the rest of the year they spend totally on the wing night and day!</p>

                    <p>Fields of winter sown Barley were swept by the breeze switching their swathe of green to different shades as they ebbed and flowed on this brightest of days whilst verdant fields of spring sown Wheat looked as if they had just been given a crew-cut.</p>

                    <p>A distant Wheatear proved difficult to see clearly as there was a heat haze rising off a bare earth field whilst a Pied Wagtail proved slightly easier to see as its ‘Everton Mint’ plumage was lit up by the sun.</p>

                    <p>Lapwing were doing their best to get on with their breeding season but as these are ground nesting birds they have suffered a set-back due to late ploughing but these plucky birds will soon set up their nests now the majority of the fields have been sown.</p>

                    <p>Then from another bare field there radiated a bright yellow glow as if the earth was rivalling the sunshine pouring from the sky and for but a brief moment we believed that the earth outshone the sun as two sunglass dazzling Yellow Wagtail chased about grabbing insects disturbed by a tractor which was preparing a field for a Coriander crop----yes we can grow such a variety of foodstuffs on our Moss---ONLY if it is not destroyed in large parts by the madness of the GMSF Greenbelt land grab!</p>

                    <p>Moving on the blustery easterly wind tried in vain to drown out the serenading Skylarks as they pronounced their lust for Spring but as expected these iconic songsters of our Salford Moss-lands were made of sterner stuff and they heartily prevailed and won the airwaves...perhaps we could invite these into the Council/Developers chambers to drown out their siren calls of doom!</p>

                    <p>Then we were upon the well appointed pathway of the LWT Nature Reserve along which we ambled pausing to note a Whitethroat scratch out its song which it has no doubt yearned to release as it made its long migration back to the land of its birth after wintering in Africa.</p>

                    <p>A Curlew then drew our attention as it quietly probed for food upon a recently sown cereal crop yes I know this is not a hilltop or a shoreline where we would normally expect to see such a bird BUT let’s not forget these mosslands are special and support so much wildlife some areas could only wish for----and they want to build on it...the mind boggles at such narrow-mindedness!</p>

                    <p>A Willow Warbler then cascaded its sweet-sweet song from atop a tall Silver Birch Tree (in my opinion THE iconic emblematic Tree of our Moss) giving us pause to take in an East to West View of this lovely nature reserve.</p>

                    <p>The Polly-Tunnel area reached we rested to give our mascot dog some of our bottled water whilst YET another summer visitor sang out its eclectic song jumble of a song—Sedge Warbler on the list—done!</p>

                <article class="panel-body">

                    <p>So, a 'new' venue for TF as a group, we landed at Bin Green car park, delighted with the abolition of the pay and display scheme, the sounds of overlapping birdsong, and that REAL rarity - an unlocked public loo, just where you want it! However, a little early disappointment crept in-the feeders marked on the map had been taken down, so no easy first hits for us....plus the toilet soon won 'Smelliest w.c. 2017' Award, although it may have been worth it just to see people fall out of the hastily unlocked gas-cabin, wiping hands on clothes and looking like they'd been chased by a pack of wolves....</p>
     
                    <p>Anyway, onto the birds....plural, just! Goldfinches atop reviled lavatory was first spot ( given the pigsty of their nest on 'Springwatch' one year, this didn't overly surprise..), followed by great and blue tit, plus robin and blackbird...and unmistakable willow warbler descending notes, which surrounded us for most of the day. Our first view over the water gave us a good profile of 'Red Indian Rocks' , and close views of chaffinch and wren, but no peregrines in sight- high up swifts our consolation! We followed the path anti-clockwise around the reservoir, and pretty it was too-late English bluebells formed their perfect curve, and marsh marigolds decorated the odd pool. There weren't an excessive amount of birds to see, it has to be said ,but constant birdsong-  enough to keep us chirpy if not electrified. So we stopped to watch jackdaw and pheasant in an adjoining field, and kept up quite a fast pace for us i.e. possibly one mile per hour!</p> 

                    <p>The dizzy heights.... We had an exciting moment when we heard the cuckoo, quite distant, but my first of the year, and always thrilling. We reached the waters edge and overflow arrangements, to find a solitary white dove, a grey and pied wagtail, some mallard and a single black headed gull -this is one stretch of water not over-run with wildfowl....even the Canada geese favoured it not! We walked to the RSPB van, watching a couple of swallows swoop and dive round a tree in the almost-sunshine, and along past the sailing club and path-friendly mallards, to the sound of wheezing greenfinch. We picked out a coal tit , mistle thrush and songthrush, and eventually spied the omnipresent willow warbler, but probably the best performance was put on by the meadow pipits - all that parachuting about ! Past the site of the old hunting lodge we found a Canada goose at long last, and a bizarre commemorative stone to the King of Tonga at Yeoman's Hey. Our final sightings were a great spotted woodpecker for a lucky few, some long tailed tits, a coal tit in the wooded area, and a  mistle thrush singing  in the treetop- a lovely endnote, literally...</p>
      
                    <p>So, I'm sure there will be more birds at Moore next week, but always good to have a change of scene- and we may not have entirely done this lovely site justice- perhaps going 'up' rather than 'around',  for chances of ring ouzel/ red grouse/peregrine, is the thing to do, it just sounds a bit exhausting for us laid back souls!! </p>

            <article id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">

                <article class="panel-body">

                    <p>Having fully rehydrated themselves, after last week's draining trip to Moore, twelve TF members gathered at possibly the noisiest meeting point on their schedule, the bridge overlooking the motorway at Frodsham. The birds here probably have to shout themselves hoarse to make themselves heard, just as we did.</p>

                    <p>Due to the din I'm not sure if I heard this correctly, but apparently filled with the euphoria created by her home town club gaining promotion to the premiership, Jude is trying to get her partly-domesticated collared dove, Colin, to switch allegiances. She wants him to now sing Huddersfield, or possibly T'town. It's only been partially successful, but she has got as far as turning him into a Barnsley supporter. You couldn't make it up, could you? Well, probably you could.</p>

                    <p>For the sake of our vocal chords, we moved off the bridge to the relative calm that could be found further down 'Brook Furlong', n.b. as you can see they've still not gone fully metric in Frodsham and following 'Brexit' they probably never will. Here we could discuss our early spots, i.e. Rook, Goldfinch, and Jackdaw and then select a route for the day, i.e. follow 'Brook Furlong' towards the ship canal and the wind farm.</p>

                    <p>We didn't get far however, as our first conundrum of the day had us divided. It was small brown with an eye stripe, but its song was wrong and too loud for either a Chiffchaff, or Willow Warbler, a Garden Warbler maybe, but the eye strip was wrong. We agreed to disagree and decided to let a zoom lens decide it for us, so no pressure Pete.</p>

                    <p>A little further down the lane and we had good sightings of Blackbird, BlackCap, Dunnock, a Kestrel perched on a pylon and,100% definite this time, Willow Warbler and Chiffchaff. Under the cover of the bushes a Cetti's Warbler was using its super larynx to belt out a song. Either that, or there was a birder on the other side with a birdsong app on his phone.</p>

                    <p>We now came to a field that was fenced off for use by the FDWC (Frodsham and District Wildfowlers Club), the local shooting club. We didn't linger at a spot where so many geese had probably been killed, but did notice two pheasants and a rabbit blissfully unaware of the danger.</p>

                    <p>Our gloomy mood continued as we passed a load of mattresses and other rubbish that had been fly-tipped, but it was immediately lightened by a couple of bushes that had been neatly clipped into unusual shapes. Does the FDTS (Frodsham and District Topiary Society) hone its skills out here? Beech and conifer had also been planted amongst the brambles, Were they being lined up for a future trim?</p>

                    <p>Our next spots were a Whitethroat and couple of fluffy birds with eye stripes that had us playing that seasonal game, 'Fledgling, or Fully Grown'. On a wind turbine two hoped for peregrines turned out to be a couple of blokes sticking their heads over the parapet, but they still went down in the notebook.</p>

                    <p>When we reached the muddy path that leads to the bend in the Weaver, Christine and Chris decided to ignore the warnings of our Health and Safety Officer and branch off on their own. We on the other hand continued on our trek to the ship canal, hoping that our ten pairs of eyes would prove better than their two.</p>

                    <p>We were soon adding Black Headed Gull, Canada Goose, Shelduck, Swallow, Magpie, Buzzard, Mallard, Skylark, a flock of Black-Tailed Godwits and finally a fluffy Meadow Pipit on a log, or could it possibly have been another fledgling.</p>

                    <p>On reaching the canal we got a special spot, our first sighting of the year of a cuckoo. It was flying towards the Weaver, so perhaps the two Chris's saw it too. By the canal our tally was swelled by adding Greylag Goose and goslings, Gadwall, Tufted Duck, Grey Heron and two cowardly Oystercatchers who were scared from their posts by a Pied Wagtail alighting next to them.</p>

                    <p>With approaching black clouds we decided that the time had come to hurry back to our cars, but couldn't resist taking in the Weaver ourselves, to see Reed Bunting, Reed Warbler, Sedge Warbler and Black-Backed Gull.</p>

                    <p>Having sacked our Health and Safety Officer, we took a perilous shortcut down a slippery path surrounded by nettles; across a field full of bullocks; along a track of ankle deep mud, over the mattresses at the fly-tip and back to our cars. Perhaps HSO's have their uses after all!</p>

                    <p>Back at the cars, the rain, which had stopped as soon as we left them, promptly started again as we got back in. Obviously that back-hander to the weather fairy was money well spent.</p>

                <article class="panel-body">

                    <p>So seven election die-hards (or deniers!) assembled at 'redstart' car park, and IMMEDIATELY set a new record, in that everyone had remembered their lunch! Hurrah!  So probable survival established, we looked doubtfully at the threatening black clouds, but the chiff chaff, wren and songthrush were already belting out song, the sun appeared, the  liquorice all sorts arrived....and suddenly we were off!! The first walk by the barn gave us a beeeautiful male redstart atop the tiles, but as it flew into the trees, we continued to the water, where we laughed at herons sat in trees, placed like Christmas decorations, with precision spacing...  We then browsed 'the usuals'- Canada's, lesser black backed gulls, coot, mallard, pied wagtail, curlew and lapwing in flight, pheasant dashing and buzzards and swallows up high. But it was our walk back and around the barn that was our highlight-male and female redstart, beaks stuffed with dead insects, disappearing in and out, posing, soakling up the rays... magic! The boarded up barn that contains magic....this is why we force our TF drivers up these steep single track roads! After we felt we could risk disturbing them for no longer, we returned to the cars, to close buzzard, with sunlight filtering through the feathers in quite an unearthly fashion....plus low swift and treetop chaffinch to complete the scene.</p>
       
                    <p>Stop 2 is Pym's Chair,and the windy car park enveloped us in skylark song from the opening of car doors, fantastic and close. But the red grouse were elusive, so after a bit more buzzard and crow spotting, we moved on.</p>

                    <p>Errwood Hall is rendezvous trois, where we actually do a bit of walking to make us feel like we deserve lunch... We heard willow warbler, goldfinch and chaffinch in the car park, but first made our way over to the lake to peruse a very odd scarecrow-fisherman.... but the grey wagtail was there also, as if  to reward our nosiness. Along the river then, a dipper for some, a common sandpiper for everyone, and great spotted woodpeckers making two appearances. Only Chris saw any pied flycatchers, but we had willow warbler, blue and great tit, lots if young birds, robin, chiff chaff and redstart again-so we were not disappointed. When it looked like rain we hopped back in the cars....cowards...</p>

                    <p>Lunch was taken overlooking the river from the two benches-and our now customary in-sandwich entertainment appeared on cue -the dipper. The sun shone, the bread munched, the dipper scratched....fabulous. (One TFer was heard complaining it didn't 'dip' enough, but there's no pleasing some people....) Wren and titmice in the bushes shouldn't be overlooked, plus another great spotted woodpecker on our return to the cars, but the non-dipping dipper stole the show...</p>

                    <p>Stopoff five, or 'Windy moor', is our usual would-be owl hunt, but today numerous red grouse gave it a different flavour. Some were quite close, heads aloft, and with meadow pipit parachuting about, the effect was somewhat charming....</p>

                    <p>Our penultimate venue on the 'Goyt road trip' is 'Ring ouzel chimney'-and boy, it lived up to its name! Both sexes, close, lots and lots of good viewing time, this was a real treat. The wheatears vied for our attention, and they were mighty splendid, on posts, gate, thistles, dry stone walls-we got to see from all angles....but the blackbirds-with-collars kept popping up, refusing to be outshone! We also spied dunnock, and curlew mobbing crows, but having had about ten hours sleep between all of us from exit poles to daybreak, we were getting tired...</p>

                    <p>Most made one last little stop down the road, to a lay-by to the right, where a field and deserted farm building gave us golden plover and lapwing up close. A lovely ending to a lovely day...(hung parliaments go hang...our window of beauty might get us through another week of "wheat fields" nonsense -we hope!!)</p>

                <article class="panel-body">

                    <p>The sky offered a blank canvas upon which we were free to scribble our day, a day which we ‘knew’ would perhaps give us few opportunities for artistic expression, a day in which we would leave our iridescent ‘Posca’ Markers for other more colourfully expressive encounters to come BUT all the same Team Friday were on site and ready  for the last time this season to amble about yet another arena of nature assured that ‘something’ in the wild would colour our collective imagination....as long as patience was exercised!</p>

                    <p>Swallow flitted about the sky over the Garden centre as we slowly moved off towards the Glaze assuring us that where we were was obviously better than South Africa at this time of the year otherwise these colourful hirundines would still be there wouldn’t they?</p>

                    <p>Then Sand Martin from their wintering grounds in Senegal passed over our heads compounding the fact that this was most assuredly THE place to be whilst closing the debate a Whitethroat sang its praise to this rather plain summers day having forsaken its southern Saharan wintering grounds!</p>

                    <p>Swift then took our attention as they somersaulted about the sky taking the rich harvest of airborne insects and spiders  which they no doubt were forming into food balls (bolus) gathering enough insects to take back to their young in nests in many a roof space in the locality.</p>

                    <p>An Oystercatcher added wader to our list  which on such a day would have its bar set rather low especially as at this stage of the year there was plenty of cover for any birds in song to hide nicely from or view.</p>

                    <p>Willow Warbler then proved the point just made for several were in song from within the generous leaf cover that hung from the glorious mix of trees that this Forestry commission hidden gem of a site provided --- none were seen—well apart from the merest glimpse of one noted by one of our team!</p>

                    <p>There was a hope at this time of the year that this site would offer the distraction (from the lack of birds) by way of Dragonflies and Butterflies but sadly it seemed as if this battleship grey of a day was keeping such winged delights in deep cover but eventually a few Meadow Brown Butterflies and Azure Damselflies graced us with their presence.</p>

                    <p>The wildflowers were admittedly a treat as swathes of Buttercups, Daisies, Vetches (various) and Orchids (Marsh) carpeted the meadow areas of this Narnia landscape that sits but a mile from the thundering traffic of the East Lancashire Road (A580).</p>

                    <p>A Buzzard or two then drew our eyes skyward with one of these valiantly attempting to hover-yes these large raptors do attempt to emulate Kestrels which if these Falcons were given score cards to hold up as they themselves effortlessly occupy a pinpoint in the sky would I’m afraid offer but nil pois  although we poor earthbound mortals I’m sure would have at least offered six out of ten for effort!</p>

                    <p>Then came the ‘battle’ of the songsters as they performed the Die Meistersingers of Nuremberg for our entertainment thus by the close of the third act we were to a person (weren’t we!) confirmed in our ability to heap equal praise upon both the fluty Blackcap and the guttural Garden Warbler whilst equally ‘sound’ in the knowledge that in the future we will with ease distinguish the two apart with aplomb!!!!</p>

                    <p>Then once we had moved through the Birch woodland in which titmice families flitted about unseen we came back out into the open where perhaps my ‘need’ for us all to see a raptor that does  occupy this sky in this area at this time of the year (when it can be bothered to show itself) allowed hope that we had one in our view but this turned out to be a Kestrel which was gamely attacking a Buzzard which moved away from this irate falcon only to be chased by a party of Carrion Crows!</p>

                    <p>Then as we arrived back at the bridge over the Glaze we paused to add Tufted Duck to our scant day list as several Banded Demoiselle Damselflies flitted above the stream adding a flourish of colour to close our wander about this quiet backwater of delight.</p>
